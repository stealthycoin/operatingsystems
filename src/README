Lottery Scheduler in MINIX
By Brilliant Squid

Instructions:
Untar, enter the directory, become root, and then run "install.sh". 
After this finishes restart minix and select option 2.

Return to the uncompressed directory (where "install.sh" was located) and enter "tests". 

Run "make" to compile the CPU bound and IO bound executables. 

You can run "perl runner.pl" for an automated testing sweet that averages five runs for each of the tasks.

If you would prefer to test manually, here are the properties of the test scripts:
- test1.sh : run two processes of the same CPU heavy program with an equal number of tickets.
- test2.sh : run two processes of the same CPU heavy program with a ratio of 1:2 tickets.
- test3.sh : run three processes of the same CPU heavy program with a ratio of 1:2:4 tickets.
- test4.sh : run four processes of the same CPU heavy program with a ratio of 1:100:100:100 tickets.
- test5.sh : run one IO bound process and one CPU heavy process. 
-----------> toggle DYNAMIC for comparison (requires reinstallation)
-----------> to see tickets being adjusted by uncommenting print statment at do_noquantum in schedule.c
